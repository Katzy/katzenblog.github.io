title: Every first has a first...
---

I can't remember the age I was the first time I had a concept of infinity, but I remember it blowing my mind (and scaring the living #$%! out of me).  Then I learned that not only does infinity run from 0 to well... a google and beyond, but it also can signify the limitless irrational numbers from 1 down to zero.  "So wait... inifity is not just the measure of everything, but it can represent the limitless shapes of something as it approaches the shape of nothingness? ...shapelessness? ...massless(ness?), but never quite gets there?"

"Precisely... and every value in between those."

"Wait, what?"

This signified the first loop in my brain that were it not for standing between two mirrors soon after, so that I could conceptualize the idea of irrationality before a tasty dinner, I might still be stuck in an infinite loop of wonder.

Fast forward a few decades and insert many firsts (and lasts), experiences that I would never trade, that have defined me.

Here I am now, re-committing myself to the world of code.  In this journey I seek to not only learn the language of the new literacy, but I intend to recode my life.  Imagine that, recoding an organism via the coding of an inanimate object.

It is my intention for this blog to serve as a repository for my ideas that my growth in this field will be continuously stimulated.  I also hope that anyone who follows in their own similar (or dissimilar) hero's journey, they may draw strength from seeing me fall along the way and watching me get back up.

Not that I'm keeping record, but I do believe I've fallen 43 thousand times prior to being able to post this blog.  I expect a lot more mental bruising, but I also expect the scar tissue to
