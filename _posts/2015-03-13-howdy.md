title: Growth
---

In the 8 months since I've started coding full time, I have experienced the kind of growth I had hoped for upon embarking on this journey.  The process of giving birth to a website, utilizing what were once unknown tools and concepts, is a very satisfying experience.

My understanding of Rails has taken me to a point that where I am less hung up on how the inner workings operate, allowing me to spend more time on learning functionality.  This is a far cry from just a four months ago where I was struggling to follow the ping pong ball of data manipulation from file to file.
My next goal over the coming several months is to improve my understanding of data structures, (trees and linked lists) and to utilize them in future projects.

As far as my next project, I'd like a project that requires me to parse larger sets of data.  This will bring me closer to my original goal of coding a stock screener that utilizes several chart reading strategies that I have learned over the years that I have traded the markets.  Since I am unable to physically identify all of the opportunties as they arise, my screener will alert me to them in real time.

Baby steps though.  Next, let's parse some data.
