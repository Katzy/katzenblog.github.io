title: Getting there
---

I've started to turn a corner in my reinvention process.  Every day I'm getting a notch closer to being a software engineer.  Since losing my mom in January, it's been a rough year to even attempt a corner turning move.  I am persevering though and tackling each kata and problem as they come.

This past month I've really wrapped my head around nodes and data structures.  I often found my head tied up in knots until that moment of understanding that... you know... feels like your brain just gave birth to a 12lb, 14oz idea?   Yeah, that one.  Such a relief that feeling and yet I crave it.

Additionally, I've really started tackling the TDD element of programming.  It's slow at first, but I've made my first contribution to an open source project by writing a test for one of their models.  Still have a ways to go with it, but I'm not afraid of you RSpec.

I've got more adept at debugging by using debugging code to identify the source of my errors.  It's really quite wonderful to help me help myself.

Isn't that what programming is all about anyway? ... helping us help eachother out in fun, fast and efficient ways.

Doing that now on my next portfolio project... stay tuned.
